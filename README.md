# 🌍 Welcome to **Neighbourly**

### Bringing Communities Together, One Shared Resource at a Time

**Neighbourly** is a community-focused app designed to help you connect with neighbors, share resources, and make a positive impact on your local environment. Instead of owning items you rarely use—like lawnmowers, tools, or grills—why not share them? Neighbourly makes it easy to save money, reduce waste, and create a sustainable community.
